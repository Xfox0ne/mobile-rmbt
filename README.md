# mobile-rmbt
A more portable version of Austrian RTRs network test

This app is based on the official version of the RMBT, which can be found here: https://github.com/rtr-nettest/open-rmbt

My project aims to make the existing software more portable while still being compatible with the specification of the test, which can be found here:
https://www.netztest.at/doc/

Disclaimer: this is not an official repository of the RTR. I am not affiliated with RTR in any way. I only do stuff with their code.
